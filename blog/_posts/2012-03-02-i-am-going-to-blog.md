Well looky here, apparently this is actually my first ever blog post, saved away in my blogger account. Looks like I
didn't finish it but I'll publish it anyway...

Being a tech-savvy guy, for years now I've thought about starting a blog but before I start I come up with reasons why I
shouldn't. Reasons like “I don't actually have anything profound to share,” and time may actually prove that I don't, or
I may say something that someone finds to be worth reading or sharing. Reasons like “I've always been meaning to make a
website for myself and I'll start blogging as a part of that”, chances are that at this rate I won't make the website,
but this is the start of a blog at least now. Even just today I started thinking that I would wait until my very first
post could be something truly profound.
