This has been a long time coming, I've setup blogs a few times and have never actually got around to the blogging part.
This time I can't really be bothered setting up a fancy blog so I'm hoping the blogging itself will be more productive.

So why would you be interested in what I've got to say? Chances are you probably won't be, or if you are interested in
one of my posts you might be waiting a while before you see another one that interests you. I don't have a particular
plan of what I will write about but it will probably be spread across my spectrum of interests and a bit of random stuff
in between. The types of posts you might see are thoughts on what I've been reading in the bible - probably just
fleshing out what I've been journalling, computing/programming/web, general tech stuff, football (soccer), and more.

I'll try to keep it organised as I go, slowly as I work out how I'm likely to use it. I've got a mental backlog of a few
things I want to write about so posts might not be in chronological order at times.

Well here I go, about to hit the publish button for the first time on my very own blog, one small step, etc. Hope you
enjoy something here if you happen to stumble across it.
